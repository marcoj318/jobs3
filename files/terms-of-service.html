                    <p>Charges for our services shall be paid either on a one-time or recurring subscription basis via
                        credit, ACH, or other means agreed between a user and us. Charges incurred on a periodic basis
                        are charged in advance and shall be subject to automatic renewal.  We may change prices at any
                        time providing you with ta prior notification and an option to cancel the subscription before it
                        occurs. Users agree to such automatic renewals and charges to users’ credit, ACH, or other
                        payment mechanism, without requiring prior authorization in each instance, subject to users
                        cancelling their accounts.
                    <p>In the event of any failure by a user to make payment, the user will be responsible for all
                        reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in collecting such amounts. We
                        reserve the right to suspend performance of the services for which a user fails to make timely
                        payment hereunder or under any other agreement with us. If the total recurring amount due cannot
                        be charged due to insufficient funds, you hereby authorize us to make a partial charge of the
                        available balance. The rest of the amount due will be charged as a separate transaction to
                        either the same card or any other card on file. Users shall be responsible for all taxes due on
                        the sale of the services to a user, including interest and penalties thereon (exclusive of taxes
                        based on the Site’s net income), which taxes shall include, without limitation, any direct or
                        indirect local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental
                        assessments of any nature, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes. Your payments

                        charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon placing your order. You agree that
                        our third-party vendors may store your payment information and update it automatically, as part
                        of the service. If your order is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging
                        your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each
                        recurring charge, until such time as you cancel the applicable order. If your payment method
                        expires and you do not change the payment information on your account you authorize us to
                        continue billing the payment method on file and you will continue to be responsible for
                        uncollected amounts. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if
                        we have already requested or received payment.

                        appear to be placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.
                    <p>Your transaction may be subject to differences in prices and foreign exchange fees, because of
                        exchange rates, depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used, and
                        where your payment method was issued. We will not make any compensation or reimbursement for

                    <h3>Dispute resolution</h3>
                    <h4>Informal Negotiations</h4>
                    <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to
                        these Terms and Conditions (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either
                        you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first
                        attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for
                        at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
                        notice from one Party to the other Party.
                    <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except
                        those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
                        arbitration. You understand that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in
                        court and have a jury trial.
                    <p>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
                        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary
                        Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at
                        the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
                        shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
                        Rules.
                    <p>The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or
                        online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
                        reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                        award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the
                        applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York County, New
                        York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
                        arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
                        judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
                    <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be
                        commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the state of New York, and
                        the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and
                        forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
                        Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
                        and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and
                        Conditions.
                    <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced
                        more than 1 year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or
                        unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
                        portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided
                        by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
                        Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                    <p>We prefer to resolve notifications directly with you, that is why we do not participate in

                    <h4>Restrictions</h4>
                    <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
                        individually. To the full extent permitted by law:
                    <ul>
                        <li>No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.
                        <li>There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or
                            to utilize class action procedures.
                        <li>There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought by a purported representative
                            capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
                        informal negotiations and binding arbitration:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the

                    </ul>
                    <p>If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the Dispute shall be decided by a
