                        "Usage information"). It may be possible for some customers to set their cookie preferences via
                        their browser’s privacy settings although doing so can interfere with your use of the Site.

                    <p>Tracking technologies, such as cookies, are used by us to store information about you on your

                        to customize and enhance your online experience. Software tools may be used during some visits
                        to measure and collect session information, such as how long it takes a page to respond,
                        download errors, how long it takes you to read certain pages, and how you interact with those
                        pages. We encode and protect the tracking technologies that the Site sets, so that only we can
                        interpret the information stored in them.
                    <p>You can encounter tracking technologies from our third-party service providers that we have
                        allowed on our Site. These assist us with various aspects of our Site operations and services,
                        such as Google Analytics. You can also encounter tracking technologies from third parties on
                        certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorized (for example, if
                        you view a web page created by another user, there can be a cookie placed by that web page).
                    <p>Tracking technologies can either be persistent (i.e. they remain on your computer until you
                        delete them) or temporary also known as session (i.e. they last only until you close your
                        browser). We use both session and persistent tracking technologies.
                    <p>We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site
                        to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and
                        compile statistics about Site usage. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,
                        similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard
                        drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We and our third-party service providers
                        may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates,
                        identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
